# MyApp

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 22.2.0.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## AI provider configuration

Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the root `.env` file to race Gemini and OpenAI for each chat request. The first non-empty successful response is returned and the other request is aborted. Requests may already incur provider charges before cancellation takes effect. You can set `ASSISTANT_MODEL` and `OPENAI_MODEL` to choose the models; defaults are `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` and `gpt-4o-mini`. Either provider can run alone when only its key is configured. Restart the server after changing `.env`.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
